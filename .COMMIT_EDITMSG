[branch name](tag[|tag]...): [subject]

[optional body]

# ** Tag
# Must be one of the following:
# * start - Start a feature/hotfix/bugfix/support/release branch
# * end - Finish a feature/hotfix/bugfix/support/release branch
# * commit - Make commit in the feature/hotfix/bugfix/support/release branch
# * merge [tag|branch] - Build merge commit
# * release - Build release commit
# * revert - Reverting things

# ** Subject
# The subject contains a succint description of the change:
# * Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
# * No dot (.) at the end.

# ** Body
# Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
# The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

# ** Rules
# The 7 rules of a great commit message
#    1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
#    2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
#    3. Summary in present tense. Not capitalized
#    4. Do not end the subject line with a period
#    5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#    6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
#    7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
